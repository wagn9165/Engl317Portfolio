# Engl317Portfolio
This is a public portfolio designed to showcase some of my coding projects.

This portfolio is broken into several parts. The first section covers some of my Python coding experience in the form of three basic scripts. The second section covers some of my PHP and HTML experience designing a website. The third section is other miscellaneous projects to demonstrate a variety of coding experience.
