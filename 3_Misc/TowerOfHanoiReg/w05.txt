Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi consists of three rods (A, B, C)and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. 
The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod A, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape. 

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack from rod A to rod C, obeying the following simple rules: 
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Implement the Tower of Hanoi. The input should be the number of disks in the original stack. The output should be a series of lines in the format:
MOVE X TO X

For example:
Move A TO B
Move B TO C
Move A TO B
Move C TO B
... etc.

Note: For these puzzels you can include math.h:
   #include <math.h>
That will give you access to: 
   exp2(value)

Note: If you wnat to test your code on a smaller stack (for example 3 disks), try this:
   /y/shared/Engineering/cs-drbc/assignments/hanoiChecker 3 <(./yourExecutable 3) N
If you chang both 3s to another number you can make the tower as big or small as you wish.
Don't forget to submit when you are done.
